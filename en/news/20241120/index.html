In the future, using the &ldquo;Hamamatsu Farm&rdquo; established in May 2024 with the support of Hamamatsu City and Hamamatsu Iwata Shinkin Bank as a foothold, we will target plant factories struggling with strawberry production and companies interested in starting strawberry cultivation, aiming to expand our sales significantly.</p><p><img src=/img/news/2024/DSC1741.webp alt="&amp;ldquo;4 presenters are lining up&amp;rdquo;"></p><h2 id=press-conference-overview>Press Conference Overview</h2><p>The conference was held in Hamamatsu City on Friday, November 8, with participation from local government officials and media representatives.

It is designed to be easily expandable and adaptable to meet the needs of plant factory businesses. It is also designed with future updates in mind for application to fruits and vegetables other than strawberries. Evolving and automating robots within the plant factory without making large-scale hardware changes is possible.</p><h3 id=strawberry-pollination-by-the-plant-factory-pollination-and-harvesting-robot-xv3-3-tier-robot>Strawberry Pollination by the Plant Factory Pollination and Harvesting Robot XV3 (3-tier robot)</h3><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/msHOLkLVRJc style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><br></p><h3 id=introduction-video-of-hamamatsu-farm>Introduction Video of Hamamatsu Farm</h3><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFDPVu2ypTk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><br></p><h2 id=about-harvestx>About HarvestX</h2><p>HarvestX Inc., founded in 2020, is a Tokyo-based startup that aims to fully automate the cultivation of fruits and vegetables that require pollination, such as strawberries, in indoor farms.
