(Head office: Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo; President: Yuki Ichikawa) established HarvestX Lab, a research and development facility for fully automated strawberry cultivation robot system, in the University of Tokyo Entrepreneur Lab.
HarvestX Lab is a dedicated R&amp;amp;D facility where we can conduct tests throughout the year in order to add more items for verification and evaluation of the robot system and to accelerate the testing cycle.
By using the same cultivation facilities as those of plant factory companies, we will reduce the difference between the development environment and the operation environment, and aim to improve the functions and quality of our products.</description></item><item><title>We have raised a total of 50 million yen in funding.</title><link>https://harvestx.jp/en/news/20210118/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 09:59:50 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://harvestx.jp/en/news/20210118/</guid><description>HarvestX Inc.
